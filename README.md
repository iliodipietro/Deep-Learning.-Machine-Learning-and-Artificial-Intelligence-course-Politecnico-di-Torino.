# Deep-Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the
human brain, learn from large amounts of data. Similarly to how we learn from experience, the deep learning
algorithm would perform a task repeatedly, each time tweaking it a little to improve the outcome. We refer to
`deep learning' because the neural networks have various (deep) layers that enable learning.
Deep Neural Networks (DNN) constitute a framework for different machine learning algorithms to allow
them to process complex data inputs. In DNN, each level extracts features from the output of the previous one.
In this homework we focused on particular types of DNN which are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
with AlexNet as a case study.
